# Cosmic Python - Arek's version

Hello stranger! This is my repo for coding alongside book [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.cosmicpython.com/)

## How to run

1. Install Poetry

    You should be already using it, but if not:

    ```bash
    pipx install poetry
    ```

    BTW, you should already be using `pipx` as well. And fish-shell! And... OK, I'll stop here.

1. Run tests

    ```bash
    make tests
    ```

    Run tests continuously (useful while coding)

    ```bash
    make tests-watch
    ```
